title: Simple C# app that uses the Citrix Netscaler C# SDK
---


I recently pushed up the 10.0 and 10.1 versions of the Citrix Netscaler C# SDK to nuget. I was browsing 
around and noticed that the C# SDK for Citrix Netscaler wasnt really getting any love on the inner-webs so 
I thought I would put just a very simple code snippet together that shows how to perform a login to the 
netscaler appliance and then list any virtual servers (load balanced) that are configured.
