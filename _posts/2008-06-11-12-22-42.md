title: Using LINQ to query SharePoint

<p>Have you heard, there is this thing called LINQ, itâ€™s all the rage these days. ;) I think everyone has at least one post about LINQ on their blog, so here is my contribution, with a SharePoint twist of course.</p>  <p>Using LINQ to query and display all list titles of a given SharePoint site.</p>  <pre lang="csharp">Microsoft.SharePoint.SPSite _site = new Microsoft.SharePoint.SPSite(&quot;http://spdev&quot;);

Microsoft.SharePoint.SPWeb _web = _site.AllWebs[0];

var _allLists = from Microsoft.SharePoint.SPList _list in _web.Lists select _list;

foreach (var _spList in _allLists)
{
	MessageBox.Show(_spList.Title);
}</pre>

<p>There is another approach for using LINQ to query SharePoint and that is to use a custom LINQ provider like the LINQ to SharePoint provider over at <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/LINQtoSharePoint/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=8713">CodePlex</a>. I havent tried this out yet but it looks like an interesting provider.</p>
