title: VS Extension to reset the Experimental Visual Studio Instance
---


In developing some extensions I grew increasing tired of having to manually reset the experimental instance of 
Visual Studio. You typically do this by deleting the required files in the AppData directory as well as the "Exp" 
key in the registry. 

Having to do this multiple times during some testing I wrote an extension and open sourced it that cleanly resets 
the experimental install of visual studio.

You can grab the extension on the Visual Studio Gallery [here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/70cf0f85-0c8e-4970-87d3-d0fc4bcb9a01)
