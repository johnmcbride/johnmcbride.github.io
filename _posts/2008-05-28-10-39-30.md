title: Finally, Sharepoint/WSS on Vista
---


<p>For as long i can remember i have had my main dev machine (Laptop) running some type of server operating system. This has been traditionally because i have been developing for Sharepoint and Citrix and those have never been able to install on a client OS like vista or XP. For me, this has been somewhat frustrating because I always end up wanting to play around with the new API's/features that inherently come with a new operating system.</p>  <p>Well thanks to our friends over at <a href="bamboosolutions.com">Bamboo Nation</a> You can now run WSS SP1 on you vista machine (Both x86 and x64)!! They have created a small installer that looks like it sets some reg keys (along with a lot of other stuff, I'm sure) to allow you to install WSS on your vista device. <a href="http://community.bamboosolutions.com/blogs/bambooteamblog/archive/2008/05/21/how-to-install-windows-sharepoint-services-3-0-sp1-on-vista-x64-x86.aspx">Check out this how-to article to get up and running</a>. Based on the article please post your experience in their forums as they would like as much feedback as possible so they can enhance the installer.</p>  <p>Update- I have run the installer and now i have WSS sp1 running on my vista64 device. WhaHoo!!!... I think this is a great step for us developers, now we can develop and test on the same device, althoughi am still going to keep my VPC lab up and running since it has a AD domain and exchange, oh..... and i still do some citrix dev too :).</p>
