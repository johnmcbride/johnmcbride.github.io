<p>As I was browsing around some blog sites trying to get caught up with some research, I noticed that there is a new SharePoint site launched. It’s called SharePoint magazine and you can check it out here. It looks very promising for our moss developers, although I haven’t read every piece of the site, but any site that provides more SharePoint info is a good thing :)</p>  <p><a href="http://sharepointmagazine.net/">SharePoint Magazine Site</a></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>I’m out!</p>
