title: Returning a data table from a LINQ query
---


<p>We are converting some of the code on a current project to use LINQ as opposed to straight SQL but being diligent architects we donâ€™t want to break the signatures of the methods returning the information.</p> <p>All of these methods were returning a System.Data.DataTable object for consumption by objects/controls. So the solution to this problem would be to perform the LINQ query inside the method without changing the signature and just return a DataTable.</p> <p>Well, fortunately for us Andres and the LINQ guys made this quiet simple. For this example I am using the Sysobjects table from the master DB</p> <p> <pre lang="csharp">
private DataTable void test ()
{
var _objects = from sobject in Sysobjects
		select new
		{
			sobject.Name
		}

System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand _cmd = (System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand) [yourdatacontext].GetComman(_objects);
System.Data.DataTable _tmpTable = new System.Data.DataTable();
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter _adpt = new System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter(_cmd);
_adpt.Fill(_tmpTable);
return tmpTable;
}
</pre></p>
