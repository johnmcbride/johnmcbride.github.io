title: Inspiration, who to turn to?
---


<p>So one of my favorite people to quote is Walt Disney. Anybody that knows me, knows that I am interested in all&#160; things Disney. Weather it is watching my children laughing and having a great time at Walt Disney World, Me acting like a big kid myself with my kids at Disney, Reading any book that is Disney related or just grabbing the new Disney movie. If it’s Disney then I’ll probably be interested in it. Lucky for me, my whole family is as much into it as I am.</p>  <p>So why do I mention this? Well, lately I have been in need of some inspiration (probably from burning the candle at both ends) , so of course I turn to some of my favorite quotes, which if you couldn't tell already are mostly from Walt Disney himself.</p>  <p>I’m going to try to post a favorite quote every day here on this blog to help keep up my inspiration :)</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Disneyland is not just another amusement park. It's unique, and I want it kept that way. Besides, you don't work for a dollar - you work to create and have fun.&quot; —Walt Disney</p></blockquote>
