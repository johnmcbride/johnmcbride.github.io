title: Accessing Infopath Form XML in a Sharepoint Library from C#… noredirect=true is the key
---


<p>I recently had a requirement to extract some information from a InfoPath XML form stored in a SharePoint library and show it in an external application. </p>  <p>The problem here was that we were using infopath forms services. and every time I tried to open up the XML file from code i would get a redirection error. GRRRRR….</p>  <p>Obviously, using the SharePoint OM would be the the quickest way for this, but it this app was not going to be run on the server.</p>  <p>The trick to this is to append this “<strong>?noredirect=true”</strong> without the quotes, to the URL that is your xm file. For example</p>  <p>This would would force a redirect to the forms services and show the browser enabled form   <br /><a href="http://johndev/training/myform1.xml">http://johndev/training/myform1.xml</a></p>  <p>However, this will for the file to no be redirected and opened up in its native application or in our case an XML document.   <br /><a href="http://johndev/training/myform1.xml?noredirect=true">http://johndev/training/myform1.xml?noredirect=true</a></p>  <p>Here is the following C# code that shows how to open and read an IP form using straight XML objects</p>  <p>The basic code here does the following    <br />1) Creates a Web Client object     <br />2) Sets credentials on the Web Client Object     <br />3) Open the InfoPath Form XML file with the xmlresolver object.     <br />4) Perform standard XPath query to get the information</p>  <pre lang="csharp">
