title: Using InfoPath to create a UDC file for SharePoint
---


<p>The guys over on the InfoPath team have posted an article (and IP form template) that allows you to use InfoPath to create a UDC file for import into a SharePoint DCL.</p>  <p>I have been using this for a while now, but just got around to blogging about it. </p>  <p>You have to download the IP template they provide and republish it to a network location, then you can run it. Check it outâ€¦. It makes my life a little easier :)</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/infopath/archive/2007/02/12/udc-file-authoring-tool.aspx" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>
