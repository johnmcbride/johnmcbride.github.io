<p>“I finally was able to get the VseWSS 1.3 CTP that supports 64bit windows installed. Installation went pretty uneventful. </p>  <p>So I fire up VS 2008 and create a new WebPart project. All is going swimmingly so far.</p>  <p>Go to deploy the project KerPlunk!!! Get the “The communication object…..” error message. Shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image6.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb6.png" width="736" height="147" /></a> </p>  <p>I seem to remember, some time ago that this message was related to WCF not being registered correctly. So after some research i came across running the following command</p>  <p>“<strong>ServiceModelReg.exe –r</strong>” from your .NET installed directory. Mine is on 64 bit so the location was in the following location.</p>  <p>“C:WindowsMicrosoft.NETFramework64v3.0Windows Communication Foundation</p>  <p>After running you should see the following screen and you should now be able to deploy a solution from VS.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image7.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb7.png" width="1001" height="646" /></a> </p>  <p>Hope this helps</p>
