I'm starting to post little videos focused on interesting developer information titled Dev:snack. 
Each one of these videos will highlight some interesting developer feature/information that I'm currently 
working on or just find interesting. The current set of videos is more targeted on some of the software I'm working 
on in my day job as a Developer Advocate at Citrix here in Fort Lauderdale. I'm always interested in your feedback 
so reach out and let me know if you like the format and what you would like to see.

Below are the first few videos, more will be coming soon.
