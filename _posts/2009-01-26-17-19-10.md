title: Accessing the ESX Web  Service WSDL
---


<p>I am prototyping some ESX integration and needed to add a reference to the ESX web service, but couldnt remember what the URL was.</p> <p>Soâ€¦. if you need to access the ESX from a Visual Studio project, You will need to add a Web Service Reference, and point the URL to the following link</p> <p><a href="https://&lt;your">https://&lt;your</a> host&gt;/sdk/vimService?wsdl</p> <p>That will give you aproxy object that you can now work with. </p> <p>Watch for more ESX/.NET posts here shortly.</p>
