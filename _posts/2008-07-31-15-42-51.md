title: Using SmartPart in SharePoint Server
---


<p>Recently I had to throw a quick little WebPart together so instead of writing all the dynamic code to create the controls, add it to the collection, etc (you know, the typical WebPart creation method) I thought I would just throw in the SmartPart and bind it to a user control. Simple enough right? well, its takes a little bit of work to get the SmartPart installed into Wss/MOSS, but once you go through the following steps you should be able to use it like butter ;)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <table border="0"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="16" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image2.png" width="15" border="0" /> </td>        <td valign="top">The first step is to download the SmartPart from codeplex. You can get it by using this link</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <ul>   <li>dgdgf </li> </ul>  <ol>   <li>     <p>adsa</p>   </li>    <li>     <p>aasdasd</p>   </li>    <li>     <p></p>   </li> </ol>
