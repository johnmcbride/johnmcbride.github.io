[JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) is the default web tool for decoding JWTs. It seems to be one of those tools that always has a tab readily available as a tab in your browser.

While this is a good workflow, which I use alot, I do like command line tools that I can use while developing projects and debugging, it make it easier if you can also have a command line tool that can use while debugging.

With that, I built a .NET Global CLI tool that you can use to parse a JWT and display it in the console.
