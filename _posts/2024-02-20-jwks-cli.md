Recently I've been having to deal alot with JWT and JWK(s). I've also noticed that alot of tutorials and guides use tools like openssl to generate and verify the JWT and JWKs. 

Given that, I found myself writing shell and powershell scripts to automate the process. Granted these tasks are not generally a daily occurance but its always frustrating when the time comes to find the github repo or place where the script resides, open the script or find the documentation to find out how to run it, etc.

So what do to? Well like any good engineer... automate it!

That's what the JWKS CLI .NET global tool is. Automating the process of JWT and JWKs.
