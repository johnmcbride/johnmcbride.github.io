title: Enabling SNMP on ESX Server
---


<p>IF you have ESX Servers somewhere in your environment you are probably going to want you ESX systems to send out SNMP traps of its state. Well, by default SNMP if turned off in the ESX install, so you will have to do some manual configuration to get it up and running.</p>  <p>No worries though, below I have listed to steps to get a simple SNMP service up and running on the ESX box.</p>  <p>The first step, is you want to log into you ESX device as root. I use putty but you can&#160; use your favorite tool here.</p>  <p>Next, you will need to modify the snmpd configuration file (which is located in the /etc/snmp directory. you can using the following command</p>  <p>vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</p>  <p>Once you have the file opened in VI, you are going to have to add a line to it, something like</p>  <p>rocommunity yourpublichstring</p>  <p>Here, the “yourpublicstring” should be replaced with your organization’s public SNMP community string.</p>  <p>Finally save the file and exit out of vi.</p>  <p>Next, you will need to start the SNMP service on the ESX box. You can issue the following command to do this</p>  <p>/etc/init.d/snmpd restart</p>  <p>That should get you up and running with SNMP on your ESX device.</p>
