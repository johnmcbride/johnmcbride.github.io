<p>Recently I had to move an internal CA from one server to another. That process in itself was a real pain, but after the move and reinstall of the cert services I had forgotten to install IIS so the cert installer did not give me the virtual directories for the web enrollment.</p>  <p>I figured i would have to create the vdirs manually but then i checked the certutil.exe utility first to see if there was anything in the help screen about vdirs. </p>  <p>Holy smokes, there is, its a –vroot paramater adding this to the certutil.ee command will automagically create you vdirs for you. SWEET!</p>  <p>If you need to recreate you certificate server virtual directories just run the following command and you will now have them in IIS</p>  <p>certutil.exe –vroot</p>  <p>out!</p>
