title: Daily Disney Quote..

<p>I like this quote because I think sometimes we rest to much on our previous successes. For me, once something is done I look to move on to a new challenge. I believe that is the only way to become successful otherwise you are always protecting what has been previously implemented and as we all know, things can change daily in technology. Remember… KEEP MOVING FORWARD!</p>  <blockquote>   <p>We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths. – Walt Disney</p></blockquote>
