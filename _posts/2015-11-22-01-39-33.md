title: Live coding sesssion - Octoblu/Citrix and .NET

We've recently added some new updates to the Citrix Developer Extension for Visual Studio to show off some of the 
feature of the Citrix Octoblu platform. To show off show of the features I put together this Live Coding session to 
show how to build a sample app that registers an application with meshblu using the meshblu API and building a 
workflow to send message to that application via web sockets, all with .NET. You can get more information on the 
[Citrix Developer Extension for Visual Studio here](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6587c715-fff3-4e2b-bf7f-10331840c552)
