<p></p>  <p>If you are in need of inspiration you need to look no further that tonight’s Olympic opening ceremony. I have just finished watching the opening ceremony and got completely inspired. I am always amazed at the human spirit and how much we can accomplish if we ignore those petty roadblocks that always seem to get in our way (and alot of them are self imposed). </p>  <p>You only have to listen to when china was walking in to the stadium, they had a little 9 years old boy walking with the flag carrier. This little boy was a survivor of the recent earthquake, dug himself out of the rubble, then went back to his school and saved 2 more children by helping then out of the rubble. IT just proves that the human spirit has no limits and we can accomplish anything that we want. There were many more stories that i would like to post about, but it’s getting late here and i’m gonna crash. The only thing i can say is I hope that I am instilling this kinda of inspiration and perseverance in my 3 girls. </p>
