<p>I thought this was an interesting post that Robert Scoble did on the building 43 site with a startup that allows you to build a kinda “Virtual Conference Hall”. Pretty interesting stuff.</p>  <p>I see more and more conferences being streamed realtime, Mix, PDC, ETC. With all those being streamed online, I’m wondering what the future of these big conferences are?&#160; Are they more like meet ups now?</p>  <p><embed src="http://blip.tv/play/g8sRgbmANAA%2Em4v" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="618" height="378" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></p>
