title: VMWare SDK HowTo- Making the VimService.dll strongly named.
---


<p>There might be a time in which you need to strongly name the VimServer.dll that gets created from the WSDL within the SDK. If you need help with that, check out a previous&#160; post <a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/?p=199" target="_blank">here</a></p>  <p>I wont re-hash the previous article but will just focus on making the DLL strongly named.</p>  <p>The first step is to create a private/public key pair. You can do this by using the .NET SDK utility sn.exe. This will create a signing file for you, that you can now use for signing. Now, if you are going to use this is production, I would probably invest in a public cert, but for the purposes of this post, thatâ€™s not necessary :)</p>  <p>So lets get to creating a signing cert.</p>  <p>Open up a command prompt, navigate to the .NET SDK directory.    <br />Execute the following command.</p>  <p><strong>sn.exe /k c:testcert.snk</strong></p>  <p>Once you have created you signing key, you will need to add it to the VimService.cs file that was generated from the WSDL. The basic steps here are to recompile the cs into a library (dll) and add the signing key to that compilation step. That can be done with the following command</p>  <p>From here to create the strongly named dll we can execute the following command.</p>  <p><strong>csc /t:library /keyfile:c:testcert.snk</strong></p>  <p>This will output a new dll with a strong name, that you can now use in your apps that need a strongly named assembly. As you can see from the screen all is good.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image8.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb8.png" width="285" height="324" /></a></p>  <p>Hope this helps.</p>
