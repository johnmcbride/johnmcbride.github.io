title: Two LINQ tools your toolbox (Free ones)
---


<p>I have been twiddling around with LINQ these past few days and cam across two tools that I really like and pretty much use them for all my LINQ query construction.</p>  <p>The first tool is a visual studio 2008 add-in called Visual LINQ Query Builder.    <br />There is a good blog from the guy that helped write here <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2008/04/02/visual-linq-query-builder-for-linq-to-sql-vlinq.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2008/04/02/visual-linq-query-builder-for-linq-to-sql-vlinq.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/mitsu/archive/2008/04/02/visual-linq-query-builder-for-linq-to-sql-vlinq.aspx</a>    <br />and you can download the setup file from the following location.    <br /><a title="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vlinq" href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vlinq">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vlinq</a>    <br />This only runs in the full blown VS tools so if your running the express editions you should probably try the next one I am going to list.</p>  <p>The next one is called LINQPad. This is another good tool but without the VS integration. You can download it from <a title="http://www.linqpad.net/" href="http://www.linqpad.net/">http://www.linqpad.net/</a> and its pretty speedy and the download is only about 2mb.</p>  <p>These tools have help me out quiet a bit here recently so I thought I should give them some props :)</p>  <p>I’m out… By the way… Did you vote today?</p>
