<p>This week X-Games 14 kicked off and it didn't take long for the big air vert guys&#160; to come up with a motivation clip. I’m sure any of us working has had those times where we feel that something we are passionate about is not being listened to, or where we don’t agree with how something is being done. Its those days that make us second guess our industry (or company).</p>  <p>During those days, just take a look at this video and remember what it took for Danny Way to pick himself up and ride the ramp again. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3517687&amp;categoryId=3075886&amp;n8pe6c=3&amp;brand=expn" target="_blank">Link is here (or click the picture)</a></p>  <p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3517687&amp;categoryId=3075886&amp;n8pe6c=3&amp;brand=expn" target="_blank"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="334" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image.png" width="441" border="0" /></a></p>
