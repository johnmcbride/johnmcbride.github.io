title: What employee's want!!!
---


<p>This post is off topic in so much that it is not related to sharepoint but none the less, i believe it is pertinent to all of us that that have managers (or that manage people). I read an article last week that over half of US workers do not enjoy their job and would leave for less pay if they had a better place to go. I mean all we want as employee's is to be passionate about the work we do, get some atta boy's every once in a while so we know our contribution is valued and to enjoy going into work in the morning right?. I don't believe that is to much to ask of company's in today's technology driven market, do you?</p>  <p>Here is an interesting ebook entitled <a href="http://www.davidzinger.com/wp-content/uploads/abcs-employee-engagement-keys.pdf">&quot;The keys of Employee Engagement&quot;</a> where each of the 12 authors lists out 26 keys for engaging with employee's. Basically, it is what we as employee's are looking for from the company's that we work for. There are a couple I like but check out the listing by Raven Young and Steve Roesler.</p>
