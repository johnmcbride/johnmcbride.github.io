title: Funny skit on politicians…
---


<p>I thought this was a pretty pertinent little skit on politicians and the current election. We see the candidates making all kinds of promises ( most of them which will never be heard from again) and spending <strong>HUGE</strong> amounts of money to run a campaign. Now I’m gonna get on my soapbox a little here. I recently read that by the time this election cycle has finished, the two campaigns will have spent a combined 200 million dollars…. THAT’s 200 MILLION DOLLARS!!!!. Why do we allow politicians to spend so much money on campaigning? Certainly we can think of better ways than spending 200 million dollars on TV add’s or the big jets for the candidates, right? Take that money and build the best 20 schools in the world (right here in the US), or maybe take 100 million dollars and give it to cancer research, or how about taking 100 million and putting it toward alternative energies? I mean, seriously, does anybody else believe that this type of spending on a campaign is ridiculous? I believe that our founding fathers would be rolling over in their grave at what our political process has become. I mean when is enough, enough?</p>  <p>Are you as frustrated with the political process as I am? Post feedback to let me know :)</p>  <p><a href="http://sendables.jibjab.com/sendables/1191/time_for_some_campaignin#/teaser/1191"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="189" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/image1.png" width="244" border="0" /></a></p>
