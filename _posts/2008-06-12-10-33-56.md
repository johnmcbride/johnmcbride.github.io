title: MOSS 2007 running on vista!! (Another Post)
---


<p>For those who read my last post you know that the guys over at bamboo solutions created an excellent package that lets you install WSS on vista. Well my first install of WSS on vista went so well I decided I would get Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed on vista.</p>  <p><strong><u>Try #1.</u></strong>     <br />1. Downloaded an ISO of SharePoint 2007 and mounted it with daemon tools.     <br />2. Ran my version of bamboo’s WssVista.Install program and selected the setup.exe file of the mounted ISO.     <br />3. ERROR: Cannot install MOSS 2007 on Windows 2008/Vista without SP1. DAMN! See screen shot. This is a known issue with installing SharePoint on Windows Server 2008, and since they both are using the same kernel now, it filters down to vista.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image5.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="196" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image-thumb5.png" width="404" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Try #2.</u></strong>     <br />1. Slipstreamed SP1 into the image file     <br />2. Re-ran WssVista.Install     <br />3. Now we get some error messages with the installer. Well, not really the installer, more likely the SharePoint setup.exe does not have the command line switches that WssVista.Install is trying to&#160; pass to it. (Screen Shot)     <br />4. Wss Kicks off into repair mode.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="264" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image-thumb2.png" width="404" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="262" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image-thumb3.png" width="404" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image4.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="342" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/image-thumb4.png" width="404" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Try #3</u></strong>     <br />1. Renamed setup.exe to sharepoint.exe (based on some forum posts) and still the same results as try #2</p>  <p><strong><u>Try #4</u></strong>     <br />1. Downloaded the SharePoint 2007 trial version for 64 bit and saved it to my desktop. ( <a title="Download x86 SharePoint 2007 Trial" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2E6E5A9C-EBF6-4F7F-8467-F4DE6BD6B831&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">X86 downloadable here</a> <a title="64bit SharePoint 2007 Download" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=3015FDE4-85F6-4CBC-812D-55701FBFB563&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">64bit downloadable here</a>)     <br />2. Run the WssVista.Install and select the newly downloaded OfficeSharePointWithSP1.exe.     <br />3. MOSS kicks off and is installing successfully.     <br />4. YES!! Success!! MOSS 2007/WSS 3.0 are now officially installed on a vista device and ready for local development. Congrads again to the guys over at bamboo solutions.</p>  <p>If your a developer (or you are studying for a SharePoint exam) and your tired of running everything in a virtual environment, you should give this option a try. <a href="http://www.bamboosolutions.com/" target="_blank">Bamboo Solutions</a> has released an update to the installer that fixes an issue where you have to rename the officeserver.exe file to sharepoint.exe file in order for it to work.     <br /><a title="WSS/MOSS Helper installer" href="http://community.bamboosolutions.com/media/p/193.aspx" target="_blank">You can get the update here</a>     <br /><a href="http://community.bamboosolutions.com/blogs/bambooteamblog/archive/2008/05/21/how-to-install-windows-sharepoint-services-3-0-sp1-on-vista-x64-x86.aspx" target="_blank">Original HowTo for install WSS on vista</a>.</p>  <p>Remember if you use it, give the guys over at bamboo some feedback by using the forum (<a href="http://community.bamboosolutions.com/forums/104.aspx" target="_blank">Located Here</a>)&#160; they setup.
