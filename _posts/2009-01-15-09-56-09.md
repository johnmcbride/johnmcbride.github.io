title: Find out the VMWare ESX Version
---


<p>So this is just an quick post for finding out the VMWare ESX version you are running.</p> <p>First connect to any one of your ESX servers. You can use any SSH utility but I like Putty. You can download it here <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once logged into the ESX box. you can run the command</p> <p>vmware –v</p> <p>This will give you the output like <br /><a href="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="65" alt="image" src="http://www.sharepoint-stuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/image-thumb.png" width="440" border="0"></a> </p> <p><br />As you can see, we are not doing a good job keeping up….</p>
