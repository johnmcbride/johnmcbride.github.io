title: LINQ (Specifying your output column names)
---


<p>I was working on some LINQ queries for an application, but ran into an issue where my output column needed to be a different name, other than the column name that was returned.</p> <p>It was rather easy but i figured I would throw it up here for future use, or for those people who haven’t run into this yet.</p> <p>Here is an original query that will return some strings but with the default column name (in this case it is “word”)</p><pre lang="csharp">from word in "one two three four five".Split()
select new
{
word
}
</pre>

<p>Here is the update LINQ expression that renames the default column to “TheWord” </p>
<p><pre lang="csharp">from word in "one two three four five".Split()
select new
{
TheWord = word
}
</pre>
