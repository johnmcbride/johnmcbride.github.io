title: SQL Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and Express editions……

<p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>Having a little extra time this weekend I figured it would be a good idea to get SQL 2008 RTM installed on a development laptop and configure SharePoint to work with it. Shouldn’t be a big issue, but as most things with technology there was a stumbling block.</p>  <p>So I fire up the install, it goes through all the standard checks and says I need Visual Studio 2008 SP1 installed. Ok, cool, so I go it the SP1 from good ol MS, Install was successful so i think all is good. Rerun the setup… KepPlunk…. Still says I have an incompatible version of visual studio 2008….</p>  <p>I start thinking it may having something to do with some of Express editions I have installed. Turns out that indeed it was checking the version of these for validation, actually it was checking a registry key in the location of HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftDevDivXXXServicing9.0SP. So, download the SP1 versions of the express products and you will be able to get SQL 2008 installed without a hitch.</p>  <p>In summary, If you ware installing SQL 2008 you need the following    <br />1) Visual Studio 2008 SP1     <br />2) If you are running the express products you need to install those&#160;&#160; SP1’s as well.     <br />3) .NET framework 3.5 SP1</p>  <p>if all the above are installed you should be ready to install SQL Server 2008.</p>
