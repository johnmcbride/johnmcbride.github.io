title: Where would a developer be without free stuff?
---


<p>In writing some of my own software for both this blog and some commercial software I cant help but give credit to the many developers out there that produce free development tools and utilities. There are so many out there that we use I thought I would put together a list of a few that I use in my day to day work. By no means, is this a comprehensive list, its just some of the tools I use. Please provide comments if you wish to add additional tools. </p>  <p>1. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> ( Excellent open source version system if you cant afford TFS)     <br />2. Toad&#160; SQL (This is a free SQL management studio for various flavors of SQL servers. At last count they were supporting MS SQ Server, MySQL, Oracle, DB2) Even though each of these are separate its a must have if you are doing database dev. <a href="http://www.toadsoft.com/">You can get the downloads here</a>     <br />3. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">Microsoft Powershell</a>. This can be a very powerful utility if you use the SharePoint OM with it.     <br />4. <a href="http://www.powershellplus.com/">Powershell+.</a> This is an awesome powershell IDE with breakpoints, script completion and a ton of over feature. A must have if you are using powershell.     <br />5. <a href="http://sharpdevelop.net/OpenSource/SD/">#develop</a> (SharpDevelop). Excellent free IDE for writing .NET code and SharePoint web parts.     <br />6. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SPCamlViewer">CAML Viewer</a>. A must have for any SharePoint developer. This makes CAML generation a snap and it is always in my toolbox.     <br />7. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/stsdev">STSDEV</a>. Another must have for any SharePoint developer     <br />8. <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>. Good tool for merging and diff'ing files.     <br />9. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">FireBug</a> (Great for seeing what stylesheets on in use on a SP site, but also great for allowing you to make real-time changes and visualize the impact.) Granted this is only a firefox tools, but i believe that IE8 will have something very similar.     <br />10. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/features">Sharepoint 2007 Features Project</a>. Some good developer tools that can be used in a dev rig. Items like logview, site actions menu that attaches to a debugger. There are some other items in this package so check it out.     <br />11. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wspbuilder">WSPBuilder</a>. Create project to help create WSP packages. Big improvement over how we used to have to create install packages.     <br />12. <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/spm">SharePoint Manager</a>. Excellent SharePoint object model explorer tool.     <br />13. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=05E0DD12-8394-402B-8936-A07FE8AFAFFD&amp;displaylang=en">WSS 3.0 SDK</a>. If your doing any development on SharePoint , this is a great resource, the only resource for many of us from the SharePoint 2003 days.     <br />14. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=6D94E307-67D9-41AC-B2D6-0074D6286FA9&amp;displaylang=en">Sharepoint Server 2007 SDK</a>. Another SDK resource.</p>
