<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Recently I have been using twitter a lot. Not for the “Here I am” type of stuff, but more for information distribution and consumption. Its a great resource and most likely will be the blog replacement of 2009.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another great twitter app is <a href="http://www.twitterleague.com">www.twitterleague.com</a>. If you haven’t checked it out, you should. You can use it to find twitter leagues and the members of those leagues. Here is the sharepoint league that i follow. You can follow me on twitter @ <a href="http://twitter.com/johnmcbride">http://twitter.com/johnmcbride</a></p> <p>Have a good new year and BE SAFE!!</p><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://scripts.twitterleague.com/v1/66.js"></script>
